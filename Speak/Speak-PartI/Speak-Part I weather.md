### What's the weather like where you live?
I live in beijing, in the nertheast part of China.
Where the spring and autumn is short while the winter and summer is very long.
In spring and autumn, the weather in Beijing is pretty good, warm with mild sunshine, It's good for go out.
while in summer, the temporature in beijing has become particularly high, and the sunlight has become hot.
Almost everyone would choose to stay at home. 
And in winter, the weather in beijing can become dry and cold, often acompanied by sandstorms.
To be honest, Beijing is not a liveable city.

### Do you prefer cold or hot weather?
I think hot weather is better than cold weather.
Especially the cold days, like in winter when the temporature is blow 0 grade.
You just can not feel your finger and toes. And hand gloves will be really needed all the time.
It's really troublesome. So I prefer hot weather.

### Do you prefer dry or wet weather?
I prefer wet weather, the reason is that my nose is very sensitive to humidity(湿度).
When the weather gets dry, just like the winter in beijing, my nose will feel uncomfortable.
And in severe cases, I even get nosebleeds.
So I don't like the dry weather.

### Are you in the habit of checking the weather forecast? when/how
No, I'm not used to checking the weather forecast, because 
    - sometimes, 
    - only if there is an outdoor activity on that day,

### What do you think are the effects of climate change in recent years?
    - summer : more hot than past,  
      - see news about somewhere are suffring from the highest heat on record, leading to wildfire.
    - winter : more cold
    - the temporature are getting more split.

### Would you like to visit other cities that have different climates from where you live?
    - for a short time, it will be okey
    - for a long time, 1 year for instance, i think it's not a good idea for me
