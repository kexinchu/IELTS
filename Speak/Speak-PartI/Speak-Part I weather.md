### What's the weather like where you live?
I live in beijing, in the nertheast part of China.
Where the spring and autumn is short while the winter and summer is very long.
In spring and autumn, the weather in Beijing is pretty good, warm with mild sunshine, It's good for go out.
while in summer, the temporature in beijing has become particularly high, and the sunlight has become hot.
Almost everyone would choose to stay at home. 
And in winter, the weather in beijing can become dry and cold, often acompanied by sandstorms.
To be honest, Beijing is not a liveable city.

### Do you prefer cold or hot weather?
I think hot weather is better than cold weather.
Especially the cold days, like in winter when the temporature is blow 0 grade.
You just can not feel your finger and toes. And hand gloves will be really needed all the time.
It's really troublesome. So I prefer hot weather.

### Do you prefer dry or wet weather?
I prefer wet weather, the reason is that my nose is very sensitive to humidity(湿度).
When the weather gets dry, just like the weather of beijing's winter, 
my nose will feel uncomfortable.
So I don't like the dry weather.

### Are you in the habit of checking the weather forecast? when/how
Yeah, because I usually go to work by bike,  So it's important for me to figure out
whether it rains or not.
If it rains, I have to go to the office by subway.
So I do checing the weather forecast almost every morning.

### What do you think are the effects of climate change in recent years?
Well, I think the most serious climate change in recent years is global warming.
because it has brought a lot of demage to our planet.
For example, it makes polar ice melt, which has brought a dire consequence to the polar ecosystem, 
and it can also cause sea level rise, which may pose the coastal cities and land to be submerged in the future.

### Would you like to visit other cities that have different climates from where you live?
Yes, I really like to visit a place where the weather is quite different from my city.
Because I lived in Beijing, where it's windy and dry almost the whole year, and the dry weather makes me uncomfortable.
So I'm looking forward to going to a city with wet weather.
