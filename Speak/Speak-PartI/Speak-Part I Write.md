### Do you write a lot?
Yeah, I'm a software engineer, my work requires me to read literatures in pure English. So almost every day, I read a lot of papers and articles.
I usually make some summaries on them, and I really need to write them down briefly, otherwise I will forget them immediately. Then I have to read them again when I forget them. So I write something down almost everyday.

### What do you like to write? Why?
Well, you probably don't think I'm serious about this question, but I particularly enjoy in writing shopping list before I go to the local supermarket. because it can remind myself what I really need to buy.

### Do you think the things you write would change?
To be honest, I have never thought about this. 
But however changes are happening almost everyday. 
Maybe I will pay more attention to the changes in the future.

### Do you prefer typing or handwriting when you are writing? （喜欢打字还是手写）
Definitely, I'd like to choose typing.
I think it's more convnient and efficient than writeing in hand. 
Because nowadays, even if you computer is not around, you can also record something with you phone easily.
And another personal reason for that is because I'm used to typing everyday. 
I mean I used to communicate with my friends by keyboard, throuth the internet and social meida. 
As for handwriting, I basely don't write by hand because it's very ugly for my handwriting.
So unless my phone and computer is not around, I prefer to choose typing rather than handwriting.
