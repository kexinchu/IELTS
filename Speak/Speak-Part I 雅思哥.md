话题准备：
### work or study？



### Write
### Do you write a lot?
Yeah, I'm a software engineer, my work requires me to read literatures in pure English. So almost every day, I read a lot of papers and articles.
I usually make some summaries on them, and I really need to write them down briefly, otherwise I will forget them immediately. Then I have to read them again when I forget them. So I write something down almost everyday.
### What do you like to write? Why?
Well, you probably don't think I'm serious about this question, but I particularly enjoy in writing shopping list before I go to the local supermarket. because it can remind myself what I really need to buy.
### Do you think the things you write would change?
To be honest, I have never thought about this. 
But however changes are happening almost everyday. 
Maybe I will pay more attention to the changes in the future.
### Do you prefer typing or handwriting when you are writing? （喜欢打字还是手写）
Definitely, I'd like to choose typing.
I think it's more convnient and efficient than writeing in hand. 
Because nowadays, even if you computer is not around, you can also record something with you phone easily.
And another personal reason for that is because I'm used to typing everyday. 
I mean I used to communicate with my friends by keyboard, throuth the internet and social meida. 
As for handwriting, I basely don't write by hand because it's very ugly for my handwriting.
So unless my phone and computer is not around, I prefer to choose typing rather than handwriting.


## Weather
### What's the weather like where you live?
I live in beijing, in the nertheast part of China.
Where the spring and autumn is short while the winter and summer is very long.
In spring and autumn, the weather in Beijing is pretty good, warm with mild sunshine, It's good for go out.
while in summer, the temporature in beijing has become particularly high, and the sunlight has become hot.
Almost everyone would choose to stay at home. 
And in winter, the weather in beijing can become dry and cold, often acompanied by sandstorms.
To be honest, Beijing is not a liveable city.
### Do you prefer cold or hot weather?
I think hot weather is better than cold weather.
Especially the cold days, like in winter when the temporature is blow 0 grade.
You just can not feel your finger and toes. And hand gloves will be really needed all the time.
It's really troublesome. So I prefer hot weather.
### Do you prefer dry or wet weather?
I prefer wet weather, the reason is that my nose is very sensitive to humidity(湿度).
When the weather gets dry, just like the weather of beijing's winter, 
my nose will feel uncomfortable.
So I don't like the dry weather.
### Are you in the habit of checking the weather forecast? when/how
Yeah, because I usually go to work by bike,  So it's important for me to figure out
whether it rains or not.
If it rains, I have to go to the office by subway.
So I do checing the weather forecast almost every morning.
### What do you think are the effects of climate change in recent years?
Well, I think the most serious climate change in recent years is global warming.
because it has brought a lot of demage to our planet.
For example, it makes polar ice melt, which has brought a dire consequence to the polar ecosystem, 
and it can also cause sea level rise, which may pose the coastal cities and land to be submerged in the future.
### Would you like to visit other cities that have different climates from where you live?
Yes, I really like to visit a place where the weather is quite different from my city.
Because I lived in Beijing, where it's windy and dry almost the whole year, and the dry weather makes me uncomfortable.
So I'm looking forward to going to a city with wet weather. 



## Technology
### What technology do you often use, computers or cellphones?
For me, it depends on different situations, the computer and cellphone has different functions and I think computer can offer big help to people who work in the office or sudy in campus. They need convenient typing and data access, which is not easy to obtain by use cellphones.
On the other hand, cellphones are very useful when you want to watch videos, read news or get other entertainment informations. Compare to computers, the cellphones are lighter and smaller, which make it easier for prople to use them at anytime and anywhere.

I would say the Apple Macbook Pro. 
Three months ago, I bought a computer because in recent days, I need to use my computer frequently to consult materials, take notes and do some excesises in preparing for my IELTS examination.
But my old computer is not as convenient to use as bebere, it too old and too heavy, while it's battery is also aging.
So I bought a new computer. 
### Is there any technology you want to buy?
Yes, sure, if I need to choose one, I would like to say the Apple Watch. Every time I excecise, such as running or cycling. I fell extremely excited when my excecise process is recorded. But the mobile phone is not always so convenient.
