Speaking of this topic, I would like to share my experience of having disagreement with my girlfriend last year. 
At that time, we were watching the movie Harry Potter, which has described a fansinating magical world. My girlfriend did not pay her attention on this story and I introduced the movie to her last year. And we have a disagreement about why Harry got married with Ginny. Because my girlfriend said she prefers Harry and Hermione and I disagreed with her.
At the beginning, I tried to persuade my girlfriend. So I collected several materials from the book and movie, and pointed out that JK rowling has described the loveline between Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione in previous stories. But she still kept her opinion. 
That experience made me disappointed and I felt unhappy. But at the end, I realized that everyone can have different opinions, we should show our respect to their ideas, even thought their ideas is different from ours. So I showed my apology to my girlfriend.

#### Describe your favorite place in your house where you can relax; You should say:
Where it is
What it is like
What you enjoy doing there
And explain why you feel relaxed at this place

Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about the sofa in my living room. I rent a small apartment in Beijing with my girlfriend, the living roon is too small to have more furnitures, so I only have a samll sofa there, and it is my favorite place in my partment. 
Although it is a small sofa which can only hold one person, but it is very soft and I can lay my back on it.
In recent months, because of work and English study, I usually go back home very late, with a tired body. So almost every day I return my house, I will lie there to relax. I don't need to change my clothes or even not take off my shoes. I enjoyed lay on the sofa and watching TV with my cellphone. And it can wind me down.
The reasons: firstly, I feel very comfortable when I lying on it. Secondly, the time I spend on it is belong to me, not like the workdays, it belongs to my boss. So lying on the sofa and watching TV can bring me a feeling that I can control my time.
