the parallax angle  视差角度

fundamental 基本的
fall into place
    - the scale of the Solar System (太阳系) would fall into place.  
precise  准确
    - While the early transit timings were as precise as instruments would allow, the measurements were dogged by the 'black drop' effect. 
establish  确定，建立
expeditions  探险队
cosmic  宇宙的
    - The AU(the distance of the Earth from the sun) is a cosmic measuring rod, and the basis of how we scale the Universe today.
